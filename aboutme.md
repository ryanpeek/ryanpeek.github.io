#### Welcome!

Hopefully you find a few interesting things while you surfing around. I've linked to a few of my research projects and data that I work with (some cool [shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps [**here**][thermohydrographs] and [**here**][gosnerstages]), and try to write some R/field related blogs.

I finished a PhD in Ecology at UC Davis in 2018, and am currently a post-doctoral researcher at the [Center for Watershed Sciences](https://watershed.ucdavis.edu/), rafting guide, soccer player, beard-wearer, quasi-musician, professional double-dad, and chocolate/coffee lover. I prefer being outside in flowing water over most any other environment, and I study among many things, frogs. In particular, I study *Rana boylii* (Foothill yellow-legged frogs) in California and Oregon. I try to keep this site updated but things get busy. [^1]

When I'm not in the office coding, helping run the [Davis R-Users Group](https://d-rug.github.io) (I'm an R junkie!), or editing/designing/writing for [The Aggie Brickyard](https://aggiebrickyard.github.io), you can find me in places like this...looking for aquatic creatures. [^n]

[^n]: no frogs were harmed during this adventure
