I hope to link up to some of the research projects and data that I work with, and write about some of my field adventures. Stay tuned as I continue to build this out...still learning the tools of the trade, and I've put this off for _**way**_ too long.\r\n\r\n### Who Am I?\r\nI'm researcher in aquatic Ecology at UC Davis, a researcher at the [Center for Watershed Sciences](watershed.ucdavis.edu), rafter, soccer player, beard wearer, quasi-musician, and chocolate/coffee lover. I prefer being outside in flowing water over most any other environment, and I study among many things, frogs.\r\n\r\n![canyon2015](https://goo.gl/photos/V2WLp66RQR38XwT96)\r\n\r\n### Find Me\r\nYou can track me down at @riverpeek (Twitter), @ryan-ucd (Github). I also write for [Natures Confluence](www.naturesconfluence.com), and occasionally the Water Blog (see [here](https://californiawaterblog.com/2016/06/05/cue-the-frogs-water-signatures-environmental-cues-and-climate-change/) and [here](https://californiawaterblog.com/2015/10/01/time-lapse-river-videos-expose-nature-in-the-raw/)).\r\n",
