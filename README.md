# My Website!

Visit **https://ryanpeek.github.io/**. It's mostly blogging about hiking, field, work, research, crazy things I've seen, and hopefully a few helpful tips on using R/RMarkdown. I've built the entire site using RMarkdown and R based code with some `jekyll` bones. 

Made with **Beautiful Jekyll**, thanks to Dean (see website and repo here: *http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll*).

I'm definitely still figuring it all out, but it's been fun, take a look!
